# Beginnings with Django
On the ***master*** branch, you'll find my first Django project, a collaboration with my coach in my first year at the company. Itâ€™s a simple website for creating, editing, and deleting notes, which taught me the basics of web development. Along the way, we experimented with integrating APIs, learning how they can expand a website's capabilities by connecting with external software.
