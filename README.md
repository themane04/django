## Beginnings with Django
On the ***master*** branch, you'll find my first Django project, a collaboration with my coach in my first year at the company. It’s a simple website for creating, editing, and deleting notes, which taught me the basics of web development. Along the way, we experimented with integrating APIs, learning how they can expand a website's capabilities by connecting with external software.

## Minigram
The [***minigram***](https://github.com/themane04/django/tree/minigram) branch showcases a more ambitious project I developed on my own: Minigram. It’s a social media platform where users can interact with posts, profiles, likes, and comments. What began as a project for learning morphed into a hobby, driven by my passion for coding and connecting people online.

I've put extra effort into Minigram, even in my free time, because it represents not just what I've learned but also what I love about development: bringing people together. Feel free to clone the minigram branch and see what Minigram is all about.

## Bridging Frontend and Backend with React
I took on a challenge to combine the strengths of Django and React, aiming for a seamless interaction between backend logic and a dynamic frontend. This led to creating two specific branches: one for developing Minigram’s frontend [***frontend***](https://github.com/themane04/django/tree/minigram_frontend_react) with React and another for adjusting the Django [***backend***](https://github.com/themane04/django/tree/minigram_backend_react) to ensure everything works together smoothly.

Despite my enthusiasm and the progress made, I haven’t finished this project yet due to time constraints. However, the groundwork is there, and it’s been an eye-opening experience seeing how these two technologies can complement each other.

This project is on pause for now, but I’m hopeful about picking it up again in the future to see through its completion.
